# Advent of Code 2023

Fourth year doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), the journey of Competitive Programming and projects has been quite fun. I'm not sure if this year I'll stick with the 25 different programming languages challenges because it takes so much time, but I'll at the very least repeat the most relevant and fun Programming Languages from last year and maybe try some new ones.
